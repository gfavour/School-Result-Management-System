				<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
			    <h3>BRIEF  HISTORY OF THE COLLEGE</h3>
		      <p>The Kwara State College of  Education, Oro was the first college of education to be established by the  Kwara State Government in 1976 as an Advance Teachers&rsquo; College with temporary  site at the then temporary site of the Federal Government College, Ilorin. It  was an off shoot of the Kwara State College of Technology, Ilorin (established  in 1974). The name of the college was changed to Kwara State College of Education,  Oro-Ilorin (i.e. Kwara State College of Education,Oro with temporary campus at  Ilorin) in Edit No 2 of 1978. The 1978 Edit was reviewed in 1984, 2006 and 2013  respectively.</p>
			    <p>			      However, for several geopolitical  reasons, the College did not move to her permanent site in Oro until 1981, when  two primary schools (St. Andrew&rsquo;s Catholic School and Muslim Community School,  Oro) were given for use as lecture rooms and offices. In January 1983, the  College moved to her present permanent site, called OKE &ndash; IROKO, occupying a  quadrangle of four blocks, in Oro. The town is about&nbsp; 50kms from&nbsp;  Ilorin, the Kwara state capital.</p>
